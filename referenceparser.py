#crawl and index using Solr

#get from Solr a list of all the document IDs in the collection. Variable is type set: solr_ids
#open each doc though Solr rest api 
#parse each document to find its own document symbol. Variable type string: doc_symbol
#create a dictionary to keep pairs [solr_id : doc_symbol]








#TODO later


#parse the body of each document to find citations to other documents e.g. A/RES/...

# write a new document keeping the citations from each document: 
# e.g. docsymbol X [docsymbol Y, Doc Z] , doc A [doc X, doc B]
